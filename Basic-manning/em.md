In Android, the `android:ems` attribute is used to specify the width of a `TextView` or `EditText` in terms of the "ems" unit.

### What is an "em"?
An "em" is a unit of width that is equal to the width of the uppercase letter "M" in the current font and text size. Using `ems` allows you to define the width of a text field based on the number of characters it can display.

### Example:
```xml
<EditText
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:ems="10" />
```

In this case, the `EditText` will be wide enough to hold approximately 10 characters of the font's default size, making the width dynamically adjust based on the font used.

### Use Cases:
- Typically used in `EditText` or `TextView` to ensure consistent width based on character size, which is useful for fields where you want the user to input a specific number of characters.
  
### Important Notes:
- If you use `android:ems`, you don't need to set a specific width (like `android:layout_width="wrap_content"`), because `ems` automatically adjusts the width based on the text size and font.
